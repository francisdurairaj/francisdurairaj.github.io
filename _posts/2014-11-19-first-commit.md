>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;

I have been away looking for blogging, suddenly today it dawned upon me that I need to start writing/posting. I thought about blogging, Wordpress flashed in my mind. Well, I wanted something that is easy to maintain and fun in doing, So I searched and found jekyll + github.io is the new trend(Since I was not aware of this, I am going for it). And this gives the benefit of not facing issues like high-traffic and high CPU load and unexpected spikes in my server. Well, those werenâ€™t too much trouble, I would avoid fixing those bugs if I was busy, and sometimes I would leave the system untouched for 2 days straight and let the server admins frown and try to mitigate the outage. .

So Let me say where to look and bring your blog up and running in no time.
